## Error fixing
if you expierience some errors please keep in mind that the csv, which is used should not include ";" as the row devider. This tool uses ","(comma) as dividing rows. This means if you run in errors just open the urls.csv with a text editor and check if there are ";" or ",". If there are ";" replace all of them with ","(commas). This sould fix the problem.
